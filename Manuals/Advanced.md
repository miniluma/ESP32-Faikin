# Advanced operation

There are a number of settings and commands that are available via MQTT. To use these you must have set up the device to connect to an MQTT server. You then need a means to send messages to the MQTT server for the device.

The *hostname* you picked is used for these messages. The format for commands and settings is defined in [RevK library](https://github.com/revk/ESP32-RevK). But is basically quite simple. We'll use `GuestAC` as the example hostname.

|Type|Format|Meaning|
|----|------|-------|
|Command|`command/GuestAC/command`|This issues commands to the device to do something now.|
|Setting|`setting/GuestAC`|This allows settings to be set. The payload is JSON, with one or more settings. e.g. `setting/GuestAC {"fanstep":2,"reporting":60}`. With no payload the existing settings are returned in the same format.|
|Setting (direct)|`setting/GuestAC/thing`|This allows a single setting to be set, the payload is the value, e.g. `setting/GuestAC/debug 1`|
|State|`state/GuestAC/whatever`|Status messages - these are normally retained and relate to specific aspects of the operation. With no paramater, e.g. `state/GuestAC` this is the state of the device itself, with `false` meaning it is now off line.|
|Event|`event/GuestAC/whatever`|Event messages are one of things that have happened and are not retained.|
|Info|`info/GuestAC/whatever`|Info messages are informational, and don't relate to a specific event happening.|
|Error|`error/GuestAC/whatever`|Errors are reported using this.|

## Settings

There are a number of standard settings as per the [RevK library](https://github.com/revk/ESP32-RevK), including things like `hostname`, `mqtthost`, `wifissid`, etc. Settings specific to the Faikin module are as follows.

The web pages provide settings for the basic WiFi/MQTT, the Faikin specific settings, and an Advanced settings page listing a lot of more detailed settings.

Note that web settings can be disabled with `websettings`, and the web based control pages can be disabled with `webcontrol`. It is also possible to apply a password for the web settings 9this is not sent security, so use with care on a local network which you control).

### Automatic on/off

Every `tsample` seconds the relationship of the adjusted *min*, *max* and *current* are assessed to consider how much time was *approaching* the target band, in the target band, or *beyond* the target band. Two whole samples in a row are considered. Sampling is reset on change of power or mode.

If `auto1` is set, the power on at start of that minute. If `auto0` is set, the power off at start of that minute.

If `autop` is set, and the last sample period is entirely outside the target band, and the current temperature is more than `autoptemp` degrees above or below the target band, then automatic power on.

If `autop` is set, and the last two sample periods are entirely inside the target band, then automatic power off.

### Remote

The system is designed to work with an external remote [Environmental monitor](https://github.com/revk/ESP32-EnvMon). This sends a command `control` periodically containing JSON with `env` being current temperature, and `target` being an array of *min* and *max* target temperature. When remote working `autop` is assumed if `autoptemp` is not `0`.

### Special settings

Some more advances settings which you are unlikely to need to ever change.

|Setting|Meaning|
|-------|-------|
|`debug`|`true` means output lots of debug - notable for S21 this is one line with a set of poll responses. This also causes more fields to be polled than normal, so slower response times.|
|`dump`|`true` means output raw serial communications|
|`isFTXM`| EXPERIMENTAL! 0 or 1 - Enable special control logic for FTXM Perfera wall mounted units. (see below) |

|`uart`|Which internal UART to use|
|`tx`|Which GPIO for tx, prefix `-` to invert the port|
|`rx`|Which GPIO for rx, prefix `-` to invert the port|

## Commands

|Command|Meaning|
|-------|-------|
|`on` `off`|Power on/off|
|`heat` `cool` `auto` `fan` `dry`|Change mode|
|`low` `medium` `high`|Change fan speed|
|`temp`|Set target temp (argument is temp)|
|`status`|Force a status report to be sent|
|`control`|JSON payload with aircon controls, see below|
|`send`|Force sending S21 message, e.g. `D62000`|

## Status

Regular status messages are sent.

- `state/` topic indicate current state, and are reported periodically and on some state changes.
- `Faikin/` topic are sent, typically every minute, and intended for the `faikinlog` command to store in a database. 
- `*MAC*/` topic are sent for HomeAssistant if enabled, and are reported periodically and on some state changes.

The setting `livestatus` causes the `state/` topic on any change.

|Attribute|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|`online`|Boolean, if the aircon is connected and online|
|`heat`|Boolean, if in heating mode|
|`slave`|Boolean, set if we are not master for heat/cool and hence cannot do requested mode|
|`antifreeze`|Boolean, set if in antifreeze mode and hence not operating as normal|
|`model`|Model name, if known|
|`home`|Temperature at remote / measured|
|`outside`|Outside temperature, if known|
|`inlet`|Inlet temperature, if known|
|`liquid`|Liquid coolant feed temperature, if known|
|`control`|Boolean, if we are under external/automatic control|

The `faikinglog` reports the last periods for values. For each value, if it is the same for the whole period it is reported as is. If not, then for numeric is reported as an array of *min*, *ave*, *max*. For an enumerated type it is the current value. For a Boolean, it is a value `0.0` to `1.0` indicating how much it was `true` in the period.

The `fixstatus` setting forces the format as if the value had changed during the period, i.e. min/ave/max array or 0.0-1.0 for Boolean.

## Aircon control

The controls are things you can change. These can be sent in a JSON payload in an MQTT command (with no suffix), and are reported in the `status` MQTT JSON.

|Attribute|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|`power`|Boolean, if aircon powered on|
|`mode`|One of `H` (Heat), `C` (Cool), `A` (Auto), `D` (Dry), `F` (Fan)|
|`temp`|Temperature, in Celcius|
|`fan`|One of `A` (Auto) and `1` to `5` for manual fan levels|
|`swingh`|Boolean - horizontal louvre swing|
|`swingv`|Boolean - vertical louvre swing|
|`powerful`|Boolean|
|`econo`|Boolean|
|`autor`|Range for automation, `0.0` means off - this sets the `autor` setting to 10 times this value|
|`autot`|Target temp for automation, This sets the `autot` setting to 10 times this value|
|`autob`|The name of the BLE device. This sets the `autob` setting|
|`auto0`|Time to turn off HH:MM, `00:00` is don't turn off. This sets the `auto0` setting|
|`auto1`|Time to turn off HH:MM, `00:00` is don't turn on. This sets the `auto1` setting|

## FTXM Mode (Experimental, untested!)

The FTXM Control Mode can be enabled via `isFTXM` setting.
It is made for FTXM Perfera wall mounted units only!
This is experimental and still under development, so your room may not have a good temperature!

Target of this option is to maintain a long running mode with highest energy efficiency and low or no on/off cycles.
Heating up very cold rooms may take a while.
The FTXM Perfera wall mounted units run in an efficient state, if the measured room temperature or inlet temperature (measured by the unit itself) and the unit target temperature are between 2 and 3.5 (with romm temp > target temp). If the difference is >= 4, the units deactivate the heating (fan stops).
The goal of this faikin control logic is to slowly heat up the room and maintain the desired room temperature at a delta temperature of 3.5. This leads to lower liquid temperatures, lower power consumption and more efficiency.

### FTXM Limitations (at the moment)

- This mode only works in heating and with auto mode active (properly set `autot` and `autor`).
- It ignores 
  - switchtemp
  - pushtemp
  - heatback
- Set autor to low values (0.2-0.5)
- Currently, no fan speed adaption. Please select a suitable fan speed for your room
- Reduce Demand Control to the lowest possible value and increase it in small steps, if your room is not getting warm enough after a while.
- Auto Demand Control for Single Split maybe comes later. 

### FTXM Todo

- Real world Testing
  - General behavior
  - Reaching and holding temperature (probably needs a factor / additional value besides heatover where deltat=3.5 is too low to hold the room temperature)
  - Effects from temperature prediction (probably needs a factor due to slow temperature movement)
- Bring back automatic fan speed adaption (incl. quite mode as lowest fan step)
- Consider multi split behavior (3MX, 4MX, 5MX outdoor units need more than 1 insoor unit active)
- Automatic Demand Control for betten efficiency and comfort
